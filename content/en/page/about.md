Our aim is to restore **Medley Interlisp** to usability on modern systems, sufficient to allow someone to develop some code and experience what it was like. You could think of this as a kind of "vintage software" project, to try to capture the sense of fluidity in the development cycle. We hope to provide a platform for demonstration of early experiments of hypertext (Notecards), Desktop management (Rooms), Object-oriented programming (LOOPS), as well as Interlisp itself.
