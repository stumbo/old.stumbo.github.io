# Goal
Our aim is to restore **Medley Interlisp** to usability on modern systems, sufficient to allow someone to develop some code and experience what it was like. You could think of this as a kind of "*vintage software*" project, to try to capture the sense of fluidity in the development cycle. 

We hope to provide a platform for demonstration of early experiments of hypertext (Notecards), Desktop management (Rooms), Object-oriented programming (LOOPS), as well as Interlisp itself.

# How
Primarily this is a matter of testing and debugging.  Identified [issues](https://github.com/interlisp/medley/issues) are documented in the Interlisp/medley repo. 

We're also trying to "*modernize*" some things; for example, we're adding Unicode support for IO (Interlisp-D was built before Unicode, and supports an older Xerox encoding). As with most open source projects, what we're able to accomplish depends on volunteers.
