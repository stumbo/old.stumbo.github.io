There is a GitHub Organization Interlisp with repositories for Maiko, Medley, this web site (Interlisp.github.io) and others. The Wiki, Releases, Issues, Discussions, are all under the Medley repository.
Objectives

The primary focus of this project is to make Medley usable enough that people can use it in a modern environment. Primarily this is a matter of testing and debugging; raise issues in the Interlisp/medley repo. But we're also trying to "modernize" some things; for example, we're adding Unicode support for IO (Interlisp-D was built before Unicode, and supports an older Xerox encoding). As with most open source projects, what we're able to accomplish depends on volunteers.
